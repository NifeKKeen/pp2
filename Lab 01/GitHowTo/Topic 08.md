# Changes, not files
Git concentrates on the changes to a file, not the file itself. A `git add file` command does not tell Git to add the file to the repository, but to note the current state of the file for it to be committed later.

We sometimes use (.) as the argument for the add command `git add .`. This is the shortest and most convenient way to add all changes in the current directory.
